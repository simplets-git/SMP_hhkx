# Terminal Grid and Cursor System Refactoring

## Overview

We've performed a comprehensive refactoring of the terminal grid alignment and cursor system to ensure consistent behavior across all terminal elements. The refactoring focused on:

1. **Grid Alignment** - Ensuring all terminal rows are properly aligned to the grid system
2. **Cursor Behavior** - Improving cursor positioning and appearance
3. **Code Organization** - Restructuring the codebase for better maintainability
4. **Consistency** - Ensuring consistent styling and behavior across all terminal elements

## Key Changes

### CSS Improvements

1. **core-layout.css**
   - Reorganized CSS with clear sections and improved comments
   - Added explicit height and width constraints for all terminal rows
   - Set overflow to visible to prevent content clipping
   - Added consistent !important flags to override conflicting styles
   - Improved grid template rows handling

2. **cursor.css**
   - Reorganized cursor styling with better structure
   - Improved underscore cursor visibility and positioning
   - Added clear sections for different cursor styles

### JavaScript Improvements

1. **terminal.js**
   - Split large methods into smaller, focused functions
   - Added better error handling and logging
   - Improved grid alignment logic
   - Enhanced message display handling

2. **dom.js**
   - Refactored cursor positioning logic into separate functions
   - Improved grid row calculation and alignment
   - Enhanced element creation and manipulation
   - Added better scrolling behavior

3. **input.js**
   - Reorganized command line handling
   - Split large methods into smaller, focused functions
   - Improved copy/paste behavior
   - Enhanced keyboard event handling

## Grid Alignment System

The grid alignment system now follows these principles:

1. All terminal rows have the same height (`--terminal-base-row-height`)
2. Grid template rows are explicitly updated when content changes
3. All elements have explicit grid row positions
4. Special rows (spacers, welcome) have fixed positions
5. Content rows are sequentially positioned starting from row 5

## Cursor System

The cursor system now:

1. Accurately positions the cursor based on text selection
2. Supports both block and underscore cursor styles
3. Properly handles cursor visibility during command execution
4. Maintains consistent appearance across different terminal states

## Future Improvements

While this refactoring addresses the immediate issues, future improvements could include:

1. Further optimization of the grid alignment system for dynamic content
2. Enhanced keyboard navigation and command history
3. Better handling of long content that spans multiple rows
4. Improved accessibility for screen readers

## Testing

The refactored code has been tested for:

1. Proper grid alignment of all terminal elements
2. Consistent cursor behavior across different terminal states
3. Proper handling of command input and output
4. Correct copy/paste behavior

These changes should provide a solid foundation for future development of the terminal system.
